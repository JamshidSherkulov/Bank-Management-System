In the Bank Account Management system, the SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes are specialized subclasses that extend the base class BankAccount.
Their roles are to represent different types of bank accounts with unique behaviors and properties. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

1. SavingsAccount
The SavingsAccount class models a bank account primarily used for saving money, often earning interest over time.

Role:
To provide a safe place for users to save money while earning interest.
To enforce restrictions on withdrawals (e.g., no overdrafts).

2. CurrentAccount
The CurrentAccount class models a bank account designed for frequent transactions, such as those used by businesses or professionals.

Role:
To support day-to-day transactions with more flexibility than a savings account.
To allow overdrafts (negative balances up to a certain limit).

Relation to BankAccount:
Both SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount inherit from BankAccount, which serves as a base class defining common properties and methods like:

accountNumber
accountHolder
balance
Methods such as deposit(), withdraw(), and checkBalance().
The base class ensures shared functionality, while the subclasses introduce specialized behaviors for savings and current accounts.
